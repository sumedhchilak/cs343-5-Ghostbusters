In the first question about Exact Inference Observation, we implemented the beliefs based
on the observed pacman distance. We later updated the beliefs based on the elapsed time.
The observe and elapseTime implementations were leveraged to choose the action that 
minimizes the distance to the closest ghost. For questions four and five, we implemented
a particle filtering algorithm to track a single ghost using approximate inference.  
For questions six and seven, we implemented a joint filtering algorithm to track
the positions of multipe ghosts simultaneously.
